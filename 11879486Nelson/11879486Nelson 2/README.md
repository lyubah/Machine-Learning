The purpose is to showcase the implementation and effectiveness of these algorithms through empirical analysis.## PrerequisitesTo run the code in this project, you need Python 3 installed on your machine. The project is designed to run on a standard Linux server with Python 3.x.## Project Structure- `bin_classifiers.py`: Contains all the binary perceptron functions. This file includes implementations of the basic perceptron algorithm tailored for binary classification tasks.- `multi_PA.py`: Hosts all the passive aggressive perceptron algorithms designed to handle scenarios with more nuanced adjustments in the learning process.- `multi_class.py`: Includes all other multi-class perceptron methods, which are used for tasks involving more than two classes.- `main.py`: The main script of the project where experiments are executed. This script calls functions from other modules and generates output.## Running the CodeTo run the experiments and generate the output, follow these steps:1. Ensure you are in the project's root directory.2. Execute the command below in the terminal:
